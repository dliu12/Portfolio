                        <h3>Mad Tea</h3>
                        <strong>Summary:</strong>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MadTea is an imagery cafe that in theory will provide services such as private study/conference space rentals in addition to the regular functionalities that a cafe would have. The webpage for MadTea would allow the customers to have a glance through the interior of the cafe, the menu for foods and drinks are available, and provide online reservation for those who are interested in renting a private space.</p>
                        <strong>Details:</strong>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The idea for MadTea is to create a space where people can temporarily have private access to, where they can do their work, study for classes, or simply just to hang out with friends without having to worry about disturbing or being disturbed by others. The motivation for creating a place like MadTea stems from my personal experience at many cafes and libraries that I have been to. Most of these spaces have small working areas (tables), lack of outlets, and are generally very cramped. If you were to meet up with a group to discuss projects or classworks, or even if you just want to meet up with your friends to hang out, you will inevitably disturb others around you. Sometimes you may choose to work in a library instead, where you may be able to have a quieter atmosphere. However, libraries also tend to be very cramped, and do not allow you to bring in small snacks or drinks. 
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;MadTea, as an imaginary cafe, aims to solve the inconvenience that would be encountered in a real life cafe or library. The website serves as a platform for customers to preview the services that MadTea will be able to provide. The website will consist of 3 main portions: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Cafe menu and price checks.</li>
                                <li>Model, floor plans, and room plans with the cafe were to exist in real life.</li>
                                <li>Reservation services for private working rooms.</li>
                            </ol> 
                        </p>
                        <p><i style="text-decoration:underline;">Designs &Layouts</i></p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The draft wireframe design for the website was done using Figma. To fit the theme for a cafe, the generic brown,coffee like is temporarily used. The design for the logo took inspiration from Alice In the Wonder’s tea party, and the sketch is as follows:(insert logo sketch)</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So far, the web site is drafted to have four main pages excluding the home page: About page, models and floor plans page, reservation page, and menu page. The most important page out of the four listed, in terms of functionality, is the reservation page.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The reservation page is planned to consist the following functions:</p>
                        <p><ol>
                            <li>Allow the customer to check for available rooms depending their desired time and dates.</li>
                            <li>Proceed to reserve with the customer’s phone number and email.</li>
                            <li>Fees are calculated depending on the room and duration that the customer decides to book.</li>
                            <li>Confirms reservation and provide customer with a reservation number.</li>
                            <li>Store the reservation information with the customer’s phone number and reservation number to allow the customer to check on their reservation information in the future using the search bar.</li>
                        </ol></p>
